Experiments from the paper
--------------------------

To run the experiments used for our publication and replicate their results please follow the instructions below

Get the images

Download/soft link the imagenet validation images into experiments/data/imagenet12-val
Download/soft link the stock abstrack images into experiments/data/stock

Compile ihog, vlfeat and matconvnet as per the instructions given at their respective webpages.

ihog: http://web.mit.edu/vondrick/ihog/

matconvnet: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/

vlfeat: http://www.vlfeat.org/


I) CNN experiments - qualitative results

    cd experiments;
    experiment_cnn;
    
This might run for several hours and generate a lot of matlab figures. Each figure contains the images used in the paper.

II) HOG, HOGle, DSIFT experiments - qualitative results

    cd experiments;
    experiment_shallow;
    
Same as before, it will generate matlab figures with the required images.

III) HOG, HOGb, HOGgle, DSIFT - quantitative results
    cd experiments;
    experiment_shallow_quantitative.m

It will generate mean and std of the normalized reconstruction error across 100 images.
For this it will compute pre-images for 100 images and this will take a very long time.

Setting up and running your own networks
----------------------------------------

1. Create a network (net) that is compatible with matconvnet vl_simplenn function.
2. Run dg\_setup.m in matlab
3. Run the network forward to generate a target reference representation y0
4. Call res = invert\_nn(net, y0, \[options\]);
5. res.output\{end\} is the required reconstruction.


DEMUD result inversion
----------------------

The inversion script for DEMUD results is `invert_fc()`. It expects the three DEMUD output CSVs for CNN feature vectors (reconstruction, residual, and selections) and inverts the top `top_n` selections.

Note that, in order to enable parallelization, you should run `parpool` in the MATLAB console first.

Ensure that the `layer` var corresponds to the layer from which the vectors were extracted - the more common values are commented.

Results are stored in /deep-goggle-jl/experiments/data/`ver`. Deep-goggle will skip an inversion if a file already exists at the location.

Note: `invert_fc()` evolved from a script that originally inverted a single feature vector. I realize now that this is probably still useful, and will include it later.
